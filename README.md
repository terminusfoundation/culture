# Culture

A project aiming to evolve human cultures and societies.

## Culture's principles

**Requirements**

All concepts and principles must fulfill the following requirements:

- bases on the scientific method
  - all concepts and principles must be self-contained
- is universal (applicable on a single individual as well as nations and humanity in whole)
- respects human nature
- is sustainabile and self-preserving
  - can interface well with existing cultures (and survive in adverse conditions)
- considers basic human rights as non-negotiable
- is elegant and simple (to understand and apply)

**Principles**

- constant change principle
- least action principle
- evolution defined by initial and boundary conditions

A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements: It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations. [Stephen Hawking]

## Human nature

- kindness - differs from culture to culture
- hospitality - almost universal, differs wildly from culture to culture, nation to nation
- tolerance - not universal, completely absent in some cultures
- fairness - not universal, understanding differs wildely from culture to culture
- censorship
- equal rights (m/f, minotiries, by age, etc.)
- hatred (towards an internal or external group)
- ignorance (i.e. western medicine considered dark magic in underdeveloped regions, all people of the world share a common believe in freedom, education and kindness in overdeveloped regions)
- gratitude - sense varies wildly
