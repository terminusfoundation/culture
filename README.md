# Culture

A project aiming to evolve human cultures and societies.

## Culture's principles

**Requirements**

All concepts and principles must fulfill the following requirements:

- bases on the scientific method
  - all concepts and principles must be self-contained
- is universal (applicable on a single individual as well as nations and humanity in whole)
- respects human nature
- is sustainabile and self-preserving
  - can interface well with existing cultures (and survive in adverse conditions)
- considers basic human rights as non-negotiable
- is elegant and simple (to understand and apply)

**Principles**

- constant change principle
- least action principle
- evolution defined by initial and boundary conditions

A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements: It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations. [Stephen Hawking]
